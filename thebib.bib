	abstract = {People communicate multimodally. Most prominently, they co-produce speech and gesture. How do they do that? Studying the interplay of both modalities has to be informed by empirically observed communication behavior. We present a corpus built of speech and gesture data gained in a controlled study. We describe 1) the setting underlying the data; 2) annotation of the data; 3) reliability evalution methods and results; and 4) applications of the corpus in the research domain of speech and gesture alignment.},
